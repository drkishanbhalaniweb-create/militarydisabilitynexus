                    The Company provides strictly non-clinical, medicolegal consultative services to assist veterans and other eligible claimants in the preparation and strategic development of claims for disability benefits before the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). By using this Site, you acknowledge and agree to the following fundamental disclaimers:

                    The Company and its contracted U.S.-licensed physicians, nurse practitioners, and other clinicians DO NOT provide medical diagnosis, clinical treatment, therapeutic advice, prescriptions, or emergency medical services. Any medical opinions rendered (e.g., in Nexus Letters, Independent Medical Opinions, or completed Disability Benefits Questionnaires) are prepared solely for submission to the VA in support of a benefits claim and are not intended, designed, or suitable for any clinical treatment purpose or medical decision-making.
                  </p>

We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or acting as an agent, representative, or employee of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Defense (DoD), or any other federal or state government agency. The appearance of official VA forms or references to VA processes on this Site is for informational purposes only and does not imply such endorsement or affiliation.

                  <p className="text-black leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The Company makes no representation, warranty, or guarantee, express or implied, regarding the success, approval, denial, specific disability rating percentage, or effective date of any VA claim. The final decision on any claim rests solely with the VA, which exercises its own discretion based on applicable laws, regulations, and the totality of evidence. Past performance or results described on this Site do not guarantee a similar outcome in your specific case.
